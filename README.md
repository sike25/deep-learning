#### Data Exploration, Modeling, Regularization and Prediction
Using TensorFlow Keras API to explore the well-known CIFAR10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) image dataset, building a simple feed-forward neural network, and evaluating the effects of playing with basic methods (activation functions, regularization, weight initialization, neuron and layer numbers etc.) to push accuracy past 53%.
