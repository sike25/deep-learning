#### Data Exploration, Modeling, Regularization and Prediction (Image Recognition)
Using TensorFlow Keras API to explore the well-known CIFAR10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) image dataset, building a simple feed-forward neural network, and evaluating the effects of playing with basic methods (activation functions, regularization, weight initialization, neuron and layer numbers etc.) to push accuracy past 53%.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (Image Recognition)
Replacing the simple multi-layer perceptron with a convolutional neural network to classify the CIFAR10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) image dataset. Trainable paramters must be kept under 200_000 and accuracy must surpass 72%.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (Activity Recognition)
We train a CNN on the [UCI Human Activity Recognition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) database. Thirty volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) to collect 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity data. The nn design task focused on building narrow and deep Conv1D kernels starting from a fixed architecture with the goal of pushing accuracy past 90%. Options available were to adjust filters, kernel sizes and other hyperparameters.
